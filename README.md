# palindrome
This application checks if a word or phrase is palindrome.
I used bootstrap to create the html file. Because of it, I didn`t make any css file. The palindrome checker page has to be simple, as the function is, and bootstrap source already made all the job of css (in this case).

To make it work you have to download these files and put it into a folder with a name of your choice. Then, just open the html file with Chrome Browser and it may work. Any issues, contact me.
